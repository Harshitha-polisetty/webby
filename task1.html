    <h1>What is Internet?</h1>
    <p>The Internet is a big network that connects computers all over the world, 
        so people can share information, talk to each other, and access websites.</p>
        <p><h4>example:</h4>When you use your phone or computer to:

            Watch a YouTube video
            
            Chat on WhatsApp
            
            Search on Google
            
            Send an email using Gmail
            
             You are using the Internet — because your device is connecting to other computers (servers) around the world to get and send information.</p>
        <h1>What is web browser?</h1>
    <p>A web browser is a software application that lets you access and view websites on the Internet.</p>
    <p><h4>example:</h4>When you open Google Chrome on your phone or computer and type in www.google.com, the browser shows you the Google homepage.

     Google Chrome is the web browser that helps you visit and see the website.</p>
    <h1>What is HTTP?</h1>
    <p>HTTP is the set of rules that computers use to send and receive webpages over the Internet.</p>
   <p><h4>example</h4>http://www.wikipedia.org
   </p>
    <h1>What is HTTPS?</h1>
    <p>HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP — it protects your data (like passwords or card details) while it's being sent between your browser and the website. </p>
    <p><h4>example</h4>https://www.amazon.in</p>
    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design webpages.</p>
